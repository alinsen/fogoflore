Dungeons and Dragons Fog of War App

NOTE: Didn't include the full suite of node_module that comes with most react projects, since it was prohibitively large to put into Git, though the app will require it for running. This should be the same node_modules folder that is used for any react-native application, and can be copied from another project and placed in the src folder to run. May eventually add in.
